# Vertex Lead Tracker

## Project Overview
Vertex is a localized lead management application designed for professional data organization. Developed by r3act.technologies, it serves as a secure tool for saving URLs and image-based data. The system operates on a decentralized storage model, ensuring that all user information remains strictly within the client-side environment.

## Core Features
* **Local Storage Architecture**: All data is saved directly to the browser's LocalStorage. No external databases or cloud services are utilized, providing a high level of privacy.
* **System Notice Protocol**: Includes an experimental feature warning system that alerts users when using image processing on mobile devices to prevent browser instability.
* **Digital Clock Interface**: A real-time synchronized clock for time-sensitive lead tracking.
* **Lead Management**: Capabilities include saving input URLs, uploading image-based leads, and bulk deletion of stored data.
* **Search Functionality**: Integrated search bar for filtering through saved leads efficiently.

## Technical Specifications
* **Frontend**: HTML5 and CSS3.
* **Typography**: Orbitron for headers and UI elements to maintain a technical aesthetic.
* **Language**: Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Optimization**: Primarily optimized for high-performance desktop environments.

## System Notice: Mobile Limitations
Vertex includes a specific protocol regarding mobile usage. Due to the memory constraints of mobile browsers and the storage limits of mobile LocalStorage, image processing is labeled as an experimental feature. Users are advised that high-resolution image uploads on mobile may exceed local memory limits and cause browser instability.
