# Simple Lead Collector

## About the Project

I created this tool to act as a focused, distraction-free space for capturing new leads. Most CRM software feels too heavy when you are just trying to jot down a name or a contact. This project is built to bridge that gap, giving you a digital scratchpad that is specifically designed for growth and outreach.

## Why This Approach?

The philosophy behind this layout is speed. When you're in the middle of a workflow, you shouldn't have to navigate through multiple menus just to save a lead. This interface keeps everything on one screen so you can record information and get back to your work immediately.

## Functionality

The system is designed with a very low learning curve:

*   Use the input field to enter lead names, emails, or notes.
*   The **Save** button commits that entry to your list.
*   The **Delete All** button is there for when you’ve finished your outreach and need to reset your workspace.

## Design Choices

The green and white palette was chosen to feel professional and calm. It’s meant to look like a clean desk—organized, intentional, and ready for business.
